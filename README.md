# health-rating-site

An healthcare providers' rating website where users would get to see honest reviews about hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories, and other medical centers. They can also give reviews about medical centers they have visited. 

Apart from viewing and giving reviews, users can also get directions to hospitals and medical centers near them. 

This website aims to solve the difficulties of finding great and functional hospitals in Nigeria and helping people get a level of assurance that they would get the best possible care in a particular hospital or healthcare center.
